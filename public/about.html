  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Vilo Web Development was born from a simple mission — to help local businesses thrive online. Founded by Arthur Rattray, Vilo is rooted in passion, resilience, and the power of turning ideas into digital experiences. After recovering from major personal challenges, Arthur turned his attention to helping others build something real.</p>
  <p>We believe websites should do more than just look good — they should connect, convert, and grow with your business. That’s what drives us.</p>
